# Shopify and Telegram Automation for Order Tracking

This project is a sophisticated automation tool that integrates Shopify and Telegram APIs to streamline order tracking and notification processes. Leveraging the power of the Requests library, the system continuously monitors new orders and cancellations on Shopify and delivers real-time updates to a designated Telegram group.



## Key Features

**Real-Time Order Tracking:** The system monitors Shopify stores around the clock, detecting new orders and cancelled transactions as they occur.

**Seamless Integration with Shopify API:** Utilizing the Shopify API, the script retrieves detailed information about each new order and cancellation, including customer details, product information, and order status.

**Instant Notification via Telegram:** Upon detecting a new order or cancellation, the system leverages the Telegram API to instantly relay the pertinent details to a dedicated Telegram group.

**24/7 Operation:** The script operates continuously, ensuring that updates are promptly delivered to the Telegram group regardless of the time of day or night.

**Customizable Alerts:** Users have the flexibility to customize the content and format of the notifications sent to the Telegram group, tailoring the messages to meet their specific needs.
## How It Works

**Enhanced Efficiency:** Automating order tracking and notification processes reduces the need for manual intervention, saving time and effort for Shopify store owners and administrators.

**Improved Customer Experience:** By promptly notifying stakeholders of order updates, the system enhances transparency and communication, fostering a positive customer experience.

**Streamlined Operations:** The integration of Shopify and Telegram APIs streamlines order management workflows, enabling businesses to operate more efficiently and responsively.
